# Research-Paper---Comparison-of-CNN-and-Contour-Algorithm-for-Number-Identification-Using-Hand-Gestur

This paper compares the performance of two methods
for hand gesture recognition for number identification. The image
is captured employing a web camera system and undergoes many
process stages before recognition of the numbers. Some of these
stages include capturing the images, noise elimination, application
of the CNN and contour algorithm to predict the number. Once the
hand is been placed in the region of interest the CNN algorithm
predicts the number and gives output in the frame using deep
learning techniques, whereas the contour algorithm creates the
boundary of the hand and predict the number using the convexity
hull defects algorithm and gives the output in the frame. The
proposed methods of CNN and Contour achieved the accuracy of
91.2% and 93.8% respectively.
